"""
utf8.decode(â€¦): The world's slowest UTF-8 decoder function.

Code to demonstrate one (mis)use of pattern matching in Python.

Also may be useful as executable pseudocode to explain how the
UTF-8 encoding/decoding algorithm works.

Maybe one day Python can have a syntax for efficient pattern matching
of bit patterns, like Erlang has:

https://erlang.org/doc/programming_examples/bit_syntax.html

Meanwhile, the `decode` function expands bytes into lists of
bits. That makes everything super slow, but allows the use of
`match/case` with a list of bits as the subject.

The `encode` function is not as slow.

Anyway, this kind of bit twiddling is much faster in C, Rust,
Go, Pascal, etc. (basically, any language that compiles to
machine code) because the bitwise operations `>>`, `|`,
`&` are native instructions in any real CPU.

Rewriting `decode` to use bitwise operators is left as an
exercise for the reader. My goal was to see how `decode`
would look like using pattern matching.
